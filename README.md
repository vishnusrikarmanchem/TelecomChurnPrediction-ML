# TelecomChurnPrediction-ML
 In the Telecom Churn Prediction project, I developed a Python-based machine learning model to predict customer churn. By creating new features and applying Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, I reduced false positives by 2%. This provided actionable insights for targeted retention strategies, helping optimize customer retention efforts.
